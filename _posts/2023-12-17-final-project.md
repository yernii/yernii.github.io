# Intro

Many people commonly mark the places they have visited or moved to, either for future reminiscence or as part of a collection. After thoughtful consideration, we decided to embark on a project that can be implemented in the short term, utilizing the skills and knowledge we acquired in this class. We aimed for our project to be realistically feasible rather than overly ambitious, with the potential to grow tremendously and become a valuable asset for future generations

# Idea:

We decided to create a “Future Humanity Visual Path Guide”. It serves as a cutting-edge web platform where users globally can mark and share the places they have visited. This interactive map creates a living, user-generated database, offering unique insights into travel patterns and cultural hotspots. We will focus on all types of travels as we will flag various types in our map.

**Key features include:**

1. Interactive Global Map: Users pin locations they've visited, contributing to a collective world map.

2. Cultural Trend Analysis: The app analyzes travel data to identify cultural and travel trends across different regions and nationalities.

3. Personalized Travel Logs: Users can create and share their travel stories, enhancing the communal experience.

4. Data Visualization: Sophisticated tools present data in engaging, easy-to-understand visual formats.

# Inspiration:

When we worked on visualizing, we had a chance to work with old corpora that included travel blogs. This prompted us to ask ourselves, what could be the modern-day equivalent of these travel vlogs for our generation? After attending a workshop this semester, we discovered Nodegoat, which inspired us with its dynamic visualizations. We aim to make our project more accessible and user-friendly. In summary, we aspire to create a vast database collection tracking people's movements around the globe.

# Importance:

1. Analyze cultural and country-based movement trends.
2. Analyze other trends, such as time and seasonal movement patterns.
3. A future database that can be utilized for research purposes
4. A viable alternative to the manual approach of marking locations on a physical map.
5. In the future, it could become an incredible platform for travel-related social media.

# Work Plan:

1. Interviews from travel bloggers
2. Test how visualization will work like on tools, like kepler
3. Create from scratch our own visualization map
4. Work on promoting the app

# User attraction

Our web-software tool will be an amazing resource for people to track their travel trips and will also allow them to share their journeys with friends. Therefore, we plan to incorporate a social media development model to attract users. I believe users will find it interesting to share their trips with community groups they can create. These groups could be categorized as 'friends', 'family', 'general', and similar divisions.

# Additional improvements:

1. Recommendation System (Using ML Models):

For the recommendation system, our ML model can analyze publicly visible data that users have shared and suggest trips based on preferences common among people from Country X.

2. Creating APIs for Research Purposes:

Over time, our platform will accumulate a significant amount of data, which could be valuable for various research purposes. Therefore, we plan to introduce an API that allows easy retrieval of our database in required formats (JSON, CSV, etc.).
